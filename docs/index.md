# Welcome on Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning web page !

Until recently, technological development was based on reducing the size of transistors and increasing the computing power of processors.
Due to the physical aspects of nature, this process must, from a certain point in, take into account the limitations of quantum physics.
The future, however, may take advantage of other tools that go beyond classical computing power. 
Although the construction of quantum computers is still an engineering stage, it turns out that it is already possible to identify and use them to create algorithms that can be used in the field of machine learning. 
The use of quantum algorithms allows to reduce the processing time of large amounts of data, and thus extends the possibilities of data processing and modelling. 
The libraries presented during the course - IBM qiskit and Pennylane (python) - allow for a simple and quick construction of any quantum algorithm. 
These algorithms, such as the VQA or QAOA, can be used for many computational machine learning problems or for the construction of quantum neural networks.
